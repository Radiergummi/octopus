# octopus [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Radiergummi/octopus.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Radiergummi/octopus)
A super simple flat file search object in PHP.  

Octopus allows searching a flat file structure, for example in a database-less CMS or a small static page.


## Installation
Octopus is a Composer-ready package without external dependencies. It works with PHP down to 5.3 and is unit-tested (see Travis!).  
To install it manually, include `Search.php` in your project.

## Usage
To start a new search, create a new `Search` object:

```php
$search = new Search('term');
```

To create a set of results, use `find()`:

```php
$results = $search->find();
```

Why the additional step? Because when a new `Search` object is constructed, default parameters will be used for the search process. To alter them, you can now use the `set()` method to provide specific settings:

```php
$search->set('path', '/path/to/search');
```

These values will be stored statically, so you only need to do this once. To set multiple values at the same time, use `configure()`:

```php
$search->configure([
  'path' => '/path/to/search',
  'surroundingTextLength' => '5'
]);
```

Another possible way'd be to create a new Search object, specifying the settings as arguments:  

```php
$search new Search(
  '/path/to/search',
  '5'
);
```

Of course, you can always edit the default values in the `__construct()` method as they most likely stay the same for your entire project.


## Configuration

Available configuration settings are:

| Name                    | Type     | Description                                           | Default value                  |
|:------------------------|:---------|:------------------------------------------------------|:-------------------------------|
| `path`                  | string   | The path in which the files to search in are located  | `/path/to/search`              |
| `excludes`              | array    | Files to explicitly exclude from searching            | `['header.php', 'footer.php']` |
| `surroundingTextLength` | int      | The amount of words surrounding the term for snippets | `5`                            |
| `resultsPerFile`        | int      | The amount of results to gather from each file        | `0` (âˆž)                        |
| `buildUrl`              | Callable | A callback for building URLs to the file with results | null (default callback)        |


## URL generating callback functions

The last parameter is a bit less self-explainatory than the rest. Usually when searching, you want to provide a link to the page the result was found in. Using a database-powered CMS, that is a pretty standard task. If you are interested in using this library, though, you probably have your own, custom CMS and handle routing your way. That's fine! You can specify a callback for generating URLs, given the respective file as an `SPLFileInfo` object.  
That provides you with, for example, the files name, its absolute path, its extension, etc. The default callback coming with *Octopus* will assume your files symbolize pages, and `path` is the root directory of your public web server. So it builds URLs like this:  
`/public/subfolder1/page1.php` becomes `http://hostname.tld/subfolder1/page1`.

Now there is much room for improvement - say, adding the fragment identifier of the nearest heading (foo.org/page#fragment) would be nice. Or maybe flat file structure drivers, or result sorting, ... .

## A basic real-world results function
The following is an example of how to actually use Octopus on a search site in your project. In case you wondering why this method is not part of Octopus itself: At some point, you'll have to use html tags to present your search results.  
Generating this HTML code inside of the class would mix content generation and presentation badly.  
Octopus already returns pretty usable data that could look like this:

```php
array {
  [0] => array {
    ["title"] => "Example Page",
    ["url"] => "/example/page",
    ["snippets"] => array {
      [0] => "[...] ipsum dolor sit <span class='term'>amet</span> consectetur adipiscing elit [...]",
      [1] => "[...] morewordsevenlongones foo bar <span class='term'>amet</span> baz bar foo [...]"
    }
  }
}
```
So below you'll find an implementation to render that data in an actually useful list.

```php
/**
 * get search results for a search term
 * 
 * @param string $searchTerm    the term to search for
 * @return string               the result list
 */
function getResults($searchTerm)
{
  // create the results set
  $results = (new Search($searchTerm))->find();
  
  // if the result list is empty, show a "no results" message
  if (empty($results)) return 'No results for' . $searchTerm;
  
  // collect the result list text
  $html = '';
  
  // iterate over results
  foreach ($results as $result => $resultProperties) {
    
    // wrap it in a block level anchor element
    $html .= '<a href="' . $resultProperties['url'] . '">';
    
      // add the page title
      $html .= '<strong>' . $resultProperties['title'] . '</strong>';

      // if we have a search snippet for the result, print it
      if (! empty($resultProperties['snippets'])) {
        foreach ($resultProperties['snippets] as $snippet) {
          $html .= '<p>' . $snippet . '</p>';
        }
      }
    
    // close the anchor element
    $html .= '</a>';
  }
  
  // return the result list
  return $html;
}
```

## Why the name?
Octopi have many arms to grab things. Which is what this library does.  
...  
Okay, bad analogy. But I love these little strange creatures :)
